Third in the New Zealand series of paperbacks, \textsl{Civilian Into Soldier} is a novel which would appear to be largely autobiographical.

Author John Lee's account of trench warfare is an assault upon 
the emotions---he saw things which few men want to see, and dares to 
describe them. His words---and what a poet of a writer he is---stun
and shatter the senses, to think that men fought and died like this.

John Lee was awarded the D.C.M. in World War I. The citation speaks of---``One 
notable feat of fearless gallantry was on the part of Private J. A. Lee. He 
tackled, single-handed, a machinegun near Wytchaete road and captured the four 
gunners. Later, when the Taranaki Company was checked by an enemy post, Lee, 
with two of his comrades, worked round behind the enemy and rushed the post, 
capturing forty men and two machine guns . . .''
